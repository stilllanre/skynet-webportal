This directory needs to contain all certificates needed by this cockroachdb node. Those can be generated by the steps
outlined in the README in the root directory, under "Setting up CockroachDB".

The only difference between the files here and those under
`docker/cockroach/certs` is that the files here need to be readable by anyone, while the files under `cockroach` need to
have their original access rights
(all \*.key files should be 600 instead of 644 there).
